Author Wordcount
================

Author Wordcount is a simple tool that allows you to enter the title of
a work-in-progress (I'm looking at you, NaNoWriMo draft), a current word
count, and a goal word count. These counters can be updated when you have
new words available, and can be deleted when you're finished. You can have
any number of works in progress at a time, since if you're like me, you've
probably got a huge collection of drafts just waiting to be finished.

The style is based on an old component that used to sit on the sidebar of
[Hugh Howey's website](http://hughhowey.com). Thanks, Hugh!

## Installation

https://wordpress.org/plugins/author-wordcount/

Place all the files in a directory inside of wp-content/plugins (for example,
author-wordcount). Activate the plugin, and make sure that you add the
widget to a sidebar.

You can find the admin page under Settings, titled Author Wordcount.
