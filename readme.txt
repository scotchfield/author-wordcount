Allows authors to show word counts for works in progress.

== Description ==

Author Wordcount is a simple tool that allows you to enter the title of
a work-in-progress (I'm looking at you, NaNoWriMo draft), a current word
count, and a goal word count. These counters can be updated when you have
new words available, and can be deleted when you're finished. You can have
any number of works in progress at a time, since if you're like me, you've
probably got a huge collection of drafts just waiting to be finished.

The style is based on an old component that used to sit on the sidebar of
[Hugh Howey's website](http://hughhowey.com). Thanks, Hugh!

== Installation ==

Place all the files in a directory inside of wp-content/plugins (for example,
author-wordcount). Activate the plugin, and make sure that you add the
widget to a sidebar.

You can find the admin page under Settings, titled Author Wordcount.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I enter in my wordcounts? =

Log in to the dashboard as an admin, click on the Settings link on the
sidebar, and look for the Author Wordcount option. If it's not there, make
sure that the plugin is installed and activated on the Plugins page.

= Why are the wordcounts not showing up on my homepage? =

Make sure that you've added the widget to a sidebar. If you visit the
Author Wordcount admin page (described in the previous question), you can
find a link at the bottom of the page that points to the widget admin
area.

== Screenshots ==

1. A demonstration of the widget activated on a main page using the
Writr theme. There are two pieces of writing in progress, and the progress
bar is filled in to represent how much work is done and how much remains.
2. A view of the admin page, where a site owner can create new pieces of
writing, and can assign current and expected wordcounts.
